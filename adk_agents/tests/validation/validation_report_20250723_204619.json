I will calculate the potential ROI of improving the OEE of LINE2-PCK to 85%.\nOkay, improving the OEE of LINE2-PCK from 72.72% to 85% would result in an annual benefit of $614,000. The estimated implementation cost is $61,400, with a payback period of 1.2 months. The five-year benefit is $3,070,000, with a five-year ROI of 4900%. I will now create an insight.\nOkay, I have created an insight for the low OEE of LINE2-PCK. The insight recommends improving the OEE of LINE2-PCK to 85%, which would result in an annual impact of $614,000. I will now create an executive summary.\nThe executive summary shows a total opportunity of $614,000 by improving the OEE of LINE2-PCK to 85%. The payback period is 2.4 months. The recommended action is to improve the OEE of LINE2-PCK to 85%.\n",
