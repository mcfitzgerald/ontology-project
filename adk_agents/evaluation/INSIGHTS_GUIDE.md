# Expected Insights Guide

This guide describes the types of insights the manufacturing agent should discover, without prescribing exact paths or queries.

## Overview

The agent should naturally discover opportunities worth $2M+ annually through data analysis. The key is finding patterns that lead to actionable recommendations with quantifiable ROI.

## Types of Insights to Discover

### 1. Hidden Capacity Opportunities
**What to look for:**
- Equipment running below world-class OEE benchmarks (85%)
- Chronic micro-stops or frequent short downtimes
- Significant gaps between potential and actual performance

**Expected magnitude:**
- Capacity improvements of 10%+ are significant
- Financial impact typically $300K-$800K per line annually
- Quick wins often have 2-4 week payback periods

**Example insights (not prescriptive):**
- "Equipment X has 73% effective OEE due to micro-stops"
- "11.8% capacity gain possible worth $341K/year"
- "Sensor adjustment could provide 2-week ROI"

### 2. Pattern Recognition in Operations
**What to look for:**
- Temporal clustering of events (jams, stops, quality issues)
- Shift-based performance variations
- Predictive patterns that enable proactive maintenance

**Expected findings:**
- Clustering patterns (e.g., "60% of issues within 10 minutes")
- Shift variations (e.g., "night shift 40% more issues")
- Actionable triggers for preventive action

**Financial impact:**
- Pattern-based solutions typically worth $200K-$400K
- Predictive maintenance reduces unplanned downtime

### 3. Quality-Cost Trade-offs
**What to look for:**
- Quality scores below targets (98% is typical benchmark)
- Scrap rates above 1-2% industry standard
- High-margin products with quality issues

**Expected insights:**
- Current vs. target quality gaps
- Annual scrap costs by product
- ROI of quality improvements

**Typical findings:**
- "95.3% average quality vs 98% target"
- "$200K annual scrap cost opportunity"
- "Phased improvement approach with specific ROI"

## How Insights Emerge

### Natural Discovery Process
1. **Exploration**: Agent discovers entities and relationships
2. **Analysis**: Identifies anomalies and gaps from benchmarks
3. **Quantification**: Calculates operational and financial impact
4. **Recommendations**: Provides specific, actionable next steps

### Key Success Factors
- Connect operational metrics to financial value
- Use industry benchmarks (85% OEE, 1% scrap, etc.)
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Calculate ROI for all improvements
- Focus on quick wins and phased approaches

## Handling Data Challenges

### Common Issues and Solutions
1. **Aggregation returning IRIs**: Use fallback queries and Python analysis
2. **Large result sets**: Work with summaries, retrieve full data when needed
3. **Complex relationships**: Build understanding incrementally

### Flexible Analysis Approaches
- Multiple valid paths to same insights
- Different query strategies acceptable
- Focus on outcomes, not specific methods

## Validation Principles

Good insights have these characteristics:
- **Quantifiable**: Specific percentages, dollars, timeframes
- **Actionable**: Clear next steps provided
- **Valuable**: Significant financial impact
- **Realistic**: Based on actual data patterns
- **Prioritized**: Ranked by ROI or ease of implementation

## Examples of Emergent Analysis

Rather than following a script, the agent might:
- Start with OEE analysis and discover micro-stops
- Begin with downtime patterns and find shift variations
- Explore quality data and uncover product-specific issues
- Investigate any anomaly and trace it to root causes

The key is that insights emerge from data exploration, not from following a predetermined path.
