# ADK Agent Refactor Summary

## Overview
Refactored the manufacturing agent to become a **discovery-driven agent** that mimics the successful iterative exploration approach from the manual prototype.

## Key Changes

### 1. Discovery Methodology in Agent Instruction
- Replaced static task-oriented instruction with discovery methodology
- Added EXPLORE → DISCOVER → QUANTIFY → RECOMMEND framework
- Emphasized curiosity, pattern detection, and value quantification

### 2. State Management with ADK Features
- Added `output_key="latest_discovery"` to auto-save insights
- Enhanced SPARQL tool to track discoveries and failed patterns in state
- Tools now use `tool_context.state` to build knowledge progressively

### 3. Enhanced SPARQL Tool
- Added `hypothesis` parameter to track what we're exploring
- Detects patterns in results (e.g., sub-benchmark performance)
- Suggests next questions based on findings
- Tracks failed patterns to avoid repeating mistakes

### 4. Discovery Patterns Tool
- Provides 5 proven analysis patterns from manual prototype:
  - hidden_capacity: Find performance gaps
  - temporal_anomaly: Time-based patterns
  - quality_tradeoff: Balance quality vs cost
  - product_impact: Product-specific performance
  - root_cause: Why problems recur
- Each pattern includes approach, starter queries, and value formulas

### 5. Insight Formatter Tool
- Formats discoveries into executive-ready insights
- Includes implementation steps and success metrics
- Calculates priority based on impact, confidence, and payback
- Creates executive summaries from multiple insights

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: One smart agent instead of complex multi-agent orchestration
2. **Flexibility**: Agent adapts based on discoveries, not rigid workflow
3. **Learning**: Tracks what works and builds on previous findings
4. **Generic**: Same approach works for any domain with structured data
5. **Value-Focused**: Every discovery connects to financial impact

## Testing

Run the test script to see the agent in action:
```bash
python adk_agents/test_discovery_agent.py
```

This runs the same queries from the manual prototype:
1. Downtime trend analysis
2. Hidden capacity discovery
3. Product-specific OEE impact
4. Micro-stop pattern recognition
5. Quality-cost trade-off analysis

## Next Steps

1. Deploy and test with real users
2. Fine-tune pattern detection based on results
3. Add more discovery patterns as we learn
4. Consider adding domain-specific patterns for other industries

The refactor successfully captures the "magic" of the manual prototype - an intelligent agent that discovers valuable insights through curiosity and iterative exploration.
