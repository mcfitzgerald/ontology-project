# LLM-Driven Manufacturing Analytics: A Generic Framework for Ontology-Based Business Intelligence

## Overview
This guide documents a comprehensive framework for using LLMs to transform natural language business questions into SPARQL queries, execute them against manufacturing ontologies, and derive actionable insights. Through three distinct analyses, we demonstrate generic patterns that uncovered $2.5M+ in annual improvement opportunities.

## Generic Analysis Framework

### Core Methodology
Transform any business question through this pipeline:
```
Business Question → Context Discovery → Query Strategy → Data Retrieval → 
Pattern Analysis → Financial Modeling → Actionable Insight → ROI Validation
```

### Universal Principles
1. **Start with WHY** - Every analysis must connect to business value
2. **Context is King** - Ontology annotations contain hidden business logic
3. **Iterate Incrementally** - Build complex insights from simple queries
4. **Validate Against Reality** - Check results match known patterns
5. **Quantify Everything** - Convert operational metrics to financial impact
6. **Pattern Over Point** - Look for trends, not single data points
7. **Action Over Analysis** - End with specific, implementable recommendations

## Technical Architecture

### Components (Generic for Any Domain)
1. **Ontology Layer**
   - Domain model with business context annotations
   - Hierarchical relationships (is-a, has-a, part-of)
   - Operational properties (metrics, states, attributes)
   - Business rules embedded as annotations

2. **Query Interface**
   - SPARQL endpoint (adapt to specific engine limitations)
   - JSON response format for easy parsing
   - Metadata for query performance tracking

3. **Analysis Toolkit**
   - **Query Execution**: curl/requests for API interaction
   - **Data Processing**: Python/pandas for calculations
   - **Pattern Recognition**: Statistical analysis libraries
   - **Visualization**: Markdown tables for CLI-friendly output

### Ontology Structure Pattern
```turtle
# Generic pattern for any domain
Domain:Entity --relationship--> Domain:RelatedEntity
Domain:Entity --hasMetric--> xsd:float
Domain:Entity --hasState--> Domain:State
Domain:Entity --occurredAt--> xsd:dateTime

# Business context as annotations
Domain:Entity domain:businessContext "Explains real-world significance"
Domain:Metric domain:targetValue "Industry benchmark"
Domain:Metric domain:calculationMethod "How derived"
```

## Analysis Patterns

### Pattern 1: Capacity/Resource Optimization
**Generic Question**: "What's the gap between current and optimal performance?"

**Approach**:
1. Identify underperforming entities
2. Calculate gap to best-practice benchmark
3. Determine affected downstream processes
4. Quantify volume/throughput loss
5. Apply financial multipliers
6. Project annual impact

**Example Applied**: Hidden manufacturing capacity worth $341K-$700K/year

### Pattern 2: Temporal Pattern Recognition
**Generic Question**: "When and why do problems cluster?"

**Approach**:
1. Extract time-series event data
2. Group by temporal dimensions (hour, shift, day)
3. Identify clustering patterns
4. Correlate with operational factors
5. Build predictive triggers
6. Calculate prevention value

**Example Applied**: Micro-stop patterns revealing $250K-$350K opportunity

### Pattern 3: Multi-Factor Trade-off Analysis
**Generic Question**: "What's the optimal balance between competing factors?"

**Approach**:
1. Identify tension between metrics (quality vs. cost, speed vs. accuracy)
2. Segment by key dimensions (product, customer, region)
3. Calculate current state costs
4. Model improvement scenarios
5. Perform break-even analysis
6. Prioritize by ROI

**Example Applied**: Quality improvements worth $200K/year with targeted investments

### Pattern 4: Root Cause Investigation
**Generic Question**: "What's really causing our problems?"

**Steps**:
1. Start with symptoms (low OEE, high costs, delays)
2. Trace through relationship chains
3. Identify common factors
4. Validate against business context
5. Quantify cascade effects

### Pattern 5: Predictive Trigger Identification
**Generic Question**: "When should we intervene?"

**Steps**:
1. Analyze historical patterns
2. Identify early warning signals
3. Calculate intervention costs vs. prevention value
4. Define action thresholds

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Discovery
```python
# 1. Load domain ontology structure
# 2. Identify key entities and relationships
# 3. Note business context annotations
# 4. Understand metric definitions
# 5. Map to business objectives
```

### Phase 2: Query Development Strategy
```sparql
# Start simple - validate basic patterns
SELECT ?entity ?metric WHERE {
    ?entity domain:hasMetric ?metric .
    FILTER(?metric < threshold)
}

# Add complexity incrementally
# - Join related entities
# - Add time windows
# - Include business logic filters
# - Aggregate for insights
```

### Phase 3: Data Retrieval & Validation
```python
# Execute queries
response = api_call(sparql_query)

# Validate results
- Check data types
- Verify ranges
- Match known patterns
- Handle engine quirks
```

### Phase 4: Pattern Analysis
```python
# Temporal patterns
hourly_patterns = group_by_time_dimension(data, 'hour')
identify_peaks(hourly_patterns)

# Correlation analysis
find_common_factors(problem_events)

# Clustering
detect_event_clusters(timestamps, threshold_minutes=15)
```

### Phase 5: Financial Modeling
```python
# Generic financial impact formula
impact = volume_loss * unit_margin * time_period

# Scenario modeling
for improvement_level in [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]:
    roi = (impact * improvement_level - investment) / investment
```

### Phase 6: Insight Generation
```markdown
# Structure insights as:
1. Current State (with evidence)
2. Root Cause (validated)
3. Impact (quantified)
4. Recommendation (specific)
5. ROI Timeline (realistic)
```

## Replication Guide

### For LLMs Implementing Similar Analyses

#### 1. Initial Prompt Structure
```
Given a [domain] ontology with [key metrics]:
1. Understand the business context from annotations
2. Identify underperforming entities using [benchmark]
3. Calculate financial impact of improvements
4. Find patterns in [time-series data]
5. Prioritize recommendations by ROI

Use SPARQL for data retrieval, Python for analysis, and always 
quantify the business impact in currency per time period.
```

#### 2. Query Development Pattern
```sparql
-- Phase 1: Discovery
SELECT DISTINCT ?type WHERE { ?entity a ?type }

-- Phase 2: Measurement
SELECT ?entity ?metric WHERE {
    ?entity domain:hasMetric ?metric .
    FILTER(?metric < benchmark)
}

-- Phase 3: Relationships
SELECT ?cause ?effect WHERE {
    ?cause domain:impacts ?effect .
    ?cause domain:hasIssue ?issue
}

-- Phase 4: Temporal
SELECT ?event ?timestamp WHERE {
    ?event domain:occurredAt ?timestamp .
    ?event domain:hasType ?problemType
} ORDER BY ?timestamp

-- Phase 5: Financial
SELECT ?entity ?volume ?value WHERE {
    ?entity domain:processes ?volume .
    ?entity domain:hasValue ?value
}
```

#### 3. Analysis Code Template
```python
# 1. Data Retrieval
def execute_sparql(query):
    response = requests.post(endpoint, json={'query': query})
    return pd.DataFrame(response.json()['data']['results'])

# 2. Pattern Detection
def find_temporal_patterns(df):
    df['hour'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp']).dt.hour
    return df.groupby('hour').size().sort_values(ascending=False)

# 3. Financial Modeling
def calculate_roi(current_performance, target, volume, margin):
    improvement = target - current_performance
    annual_value = improvement * volume * margin * 365
    return annual_value

# 4. Insight Generation
def generate_recommendations(patterns, financial_impact):
    return [{
        'issue': pattern,
        'impact': financial_impact[pattern],
        'action': get_action(pattern),
        'roi_months': calculate_payback(pattern)
    }]
```
